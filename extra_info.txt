This class, UserInputValidator, is built to clean up user input. Its main method, validate_positive_integers, takes a list of strings. It loops through each string, and if the string consists only of digits (meaning it's a whole number) and is greater than zero, it converts it to an integer and adds it to a new list. Finally, it prints a message saying the validation is complete. It's a handy tool for filtering out invalid or negative numbers from raw input data.
